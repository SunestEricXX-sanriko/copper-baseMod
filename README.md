# copper-baseMod
一个关于铜的基础模组/A basic mod for copper
添加了铜材质的头盔，胸甲，护腿，靴子，剑，斧头和镐头并根据耐久度的下降变换材质。铜斧头，镐头，和剑现在有一个新的机制：根据造成的伤害增加锈蚀度，到达阈值时提升至下一个锈蚀度，限制到锈蚀度3。
Copper-enhanced helmets, chest armor, leg guards, boots, swords, axes, and pickaxes have been added, with materials changing based on durability degradation. Copper axes, pickaxes, and swords now feature a new mechanism: rust accumulation increases based on damage dealt, advancing to the next rust level upon reaching a threshold, capped at rust level 3.
